I got room
In my fumes (yeah)
She fill my mind up with ideas
I'm the highest in the room (it's lit)
Hope I make it outta here (let's go)
She saw my eyes, she know I'm gone (ah)
I see some things that you might fear
I'm doin' a show, I'll be back soon (soon)
That ain't what she wanna hear (nah)
Now I got her in my room (ah)
Legs wrapped around my beard
Got the fastest car, it zoom (skrrt)
Hope we make it outta here (ah)
When I'm with you, I feel alive
You say you love me, don't you lie (yeah)
Won't cross my heart, don't wanna die
Keep the pistol on my side (yeah)
